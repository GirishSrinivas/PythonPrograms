SimpleText='One day, his horse ran away. The neighbors came to express their concern: "Oh, that\'s too bad. How are you going to work the fields now?" The farmer replied: "Good thing, Bad thing, Who knows?" In a few days, his horse came back and brought another horse with her. Now, the neighbors were glad: "Oh, how lucky! Now you can do twice as much work as before!" The farmer replied: "Good thing, Bad thing, Who knows?"'
